Brief notes on books about music and music cognition. On this list are books about both cognition and music: books about sythesis and signal processing are separate.

## Music Cognition in General

### [Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics](https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/3916/Music-Cognition-and-Computerized-SoundAn)
