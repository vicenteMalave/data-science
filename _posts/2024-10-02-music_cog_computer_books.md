# Music Cognition and Related Books

Brief notes on books about music and music cognition. On this list are books about both cognition and music: books about sythesis and signal processing are separate.

## Music Cognition / General

### [Music, Cognition, and Computerized Sound: An Introduction to Psychoacoustics](https://direct.mit.edu/books/edited-volume/3916/Music-Cognition-and-Computerized-SoundAn)

Most of the authors who contribute to this book were early computer music researchers at AT&T/Bell labs. 

### [Sweet Anticipation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262582780/sweet-anticipation/#:~:text=In%20unpacking%20the%20process%20of%20expectation,%20long%20understood%20to%20play)
I asked a music cognition researcher, if she could recommend one book, what it would be. David Huron is a well-known researcher, this book is also very readable, written like a pop-science book.

### [Listening - Handel}(https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262581271/listening/#:~:text=Listening%20combines%20broad%20coverage%20of%20acoustics,%20speech%20and%20music%20perception)

This is a very in-depth text on how hearing works. In humans, this has been studied for speech and music perception, and what's cool about this book is that the authors go through both the music and speech literature.

Speech synthesis has a surprisingly long history, both for communication and scientific reasons (if you're the phone company, you need to get speech right - what is speech?). This book unpacks the complicated and long history of the vocoder, including the military, industrial, and pop-culture applications.

When I heard what the topic was, I thought there was no way a journalist could have possibly covered all of this topic, but it turned out better than I could have imagined. An incredibly well documented and entertaining book, I keep giving copies to people, one of my favorite non-fiction books on any topic.

# [Spaces Speak, are you listening](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262513173/spaces-speak-are-you-listening/#:~:text=How%20we%20experience%20space%20by%20listening:%20the%20concepts%20of%20aural)

Barry Blesser was one of a handful of people who perfected and commercialized digital reverb in the 1970s. This book, is a combination of topics on how places sound: some history of inventing reverb, some speculations on anthropology. Like many books written by people who "were there" for technological history, it's a bit idiosyncratic, but also invaluble to see how someone involved was thinking.
